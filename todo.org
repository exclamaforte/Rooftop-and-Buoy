daily goals:
x1. get averaging to reduce points working
x2. fix x axis
x3. fix x scale
x4. investigate bar mechanisms
   stock has way to do that, and can clone the repo off of github.
x5. add preset and custom time menu
x6. refactor

1. interactive legends replacement for toggle buttons? Toggle buttons allow user to focus on plot. Could just do the legends as the toggle buttons.
   a. We could just move the labels to plot axis and save a lot of space. Or add them as titles.
2. change the data model to use datastore insetad of an object
3. ask about adding stuff to metobs.
x4. make plots all different colors.
5. Align x axis.



performance:
1. initialize the charts to the correct size.
2.
